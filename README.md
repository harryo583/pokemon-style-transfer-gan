Final project monorepo for NU CS_310 Scalable Software Architectures

This project implements a CycleGAN model to transform generic images into a user-selected Pokémon style. The CycleGAN framework enables unpaired image-to-image translation, allowing the creation of stylized images without requiring paired datasets. The project is built with PyTorch and utilizes torchvision for data preprocessing and augmentation.
